class ModflowPrtnam(MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowPrtnam defines a NAM package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Model that this package is a part of. Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool, default False
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    list : string
        is name of the listing file to create for this prt model.  if not specified,
        then the name of the list file will be the basename of the prt model name file
        and the '.lst' extension.  for example, if the prt name file is called
        'my.model.nam' then the list file will be called 'my.model.lst'.
    print_input : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of all model stress package information will
        be written to the listing file immediately after it is read.
    print_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of all model package flow rates will be
        printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in which 'budget
        print' is specified in output control.  if there is no output control option
        and 'print_flows' is specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time
        step of each stress period.
    save_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that all model package flow terms will be written to the
        file specified with 'budget fileout' in output control.
    packages : [(ftype, fname, pname)]
        * ftype : string
                is the file type, which must be one of the following character values shown in
                table ref{table:ftype-prt}. Ftype may be entered in any combination of
                uppercase and lowercase.
        * fname : string
                is the name of the file containing the package input.  The path to the file
                should be included if the file is not located in the folder where the program
                was run.
        * pname : string
                is the user-defined name for the package. PNAME is restricted to 16 characters.
                No spaces are allowed in PNAME.  PNAME character values are read and stored by
                the program for stress packages only.  These names may be useful for labeling
                purposes when multiple stress packages of the same type are located within a
                single PRT Model.  If PNAME is specified for a stress package, then PNAME will
                be used in the flow budget table in the listing file; it will also be used for
                the text entry in the cell-by-cell budget file.  PNAME is case insensitive and
                is stored in all upper case letters.


    filename : str or PathLike, optional
        Name or path of file where this package is stored.
    pname : str, optional
        Package name.
    **kwargs
        Extra keywords for :class:`flopy.mf6.mfpackage.MFPackage`.
