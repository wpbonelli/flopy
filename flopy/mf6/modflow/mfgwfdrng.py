class ModflowGwfdrng(MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwfdrng defines a DRNG package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Model that this package is a part of. Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool, default False
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    auxiliary : [string]
        defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  there is no limit on
        the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however,
        lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data
        for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   the number of auxiliary
        variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  comments cannot
        be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary
        variable names.  auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they
        will be available for use by other parts of the program.  the program will
        terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one
        line in the options block.
    auxmultname : string
        name of auxiliary variable to be used as multiplier of drain conductance.
    auxdepthname : string
        name of a variable listed in auxiliary that defines the depth at which drainage
        discharge will be scaled. if a positive value is specified for the auxdepthname
        auxiliary variable, then elev is the elevation at which the drain starts to
        discharge and elev + ddrn (assuming ddrn is the auxdepthname variable) is the
        elevation when the drain conductance (cond) scaling factor is 1. if a negative
        drainage depth value is specified for ddrn, then elev + ddrn is the elevation
        at which the drain starts to discharge and elev is the elevation when the
        conductance (cond) scaling factor is 1. a linear- or cubic-scaling is used to
        scale the drain conductance (cond) when the standard or newton-raphson
        formulation is used, respectively.  this discharge scaling option is described
        in more detail in chapter 3 of the supplemental technical information.
    print_input : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of drain information will be written to the
        listing file immediately after it is read.
    print_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of drain flow rates will be printed to the
        listing file for every stress period time step in which 'budget print' is
        specified in output control.  if there is no output control option and
        'print_flows' is specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step
        of each stress period.
    save_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that drain flow terms will be written to the file specified
        with 'budget fileout' in output control.
    observations : record obs6 filein obs6_filename
        Contains data for the obs package. Data can be passed as a dictionary to the
        obs package with variable names as keys and package data as values. Data for
        the observations variable is also acceptable. See obs package documentation for
        more information.
    mover : keyword
        keyword to indicate that this instance of the drain package can be used with
        the water mover (mvr) package.  when the mover option is specified, additional
        memory is allocated within the package to store the available, provided, and
        received water.
    export_array_netcdf : keyword
        keyword that specifies input gridded arrays should be written to the model
        output netcdf file with attributes that support using the generated file as a
        modflow 6 simulation input.  this option only has an effect when an output
        model netcdf file is configured and the simulation is run in validate mode,
        otherwise it is ignored.
    dev_cubic_scaling : keyword
        cubic-scaling is used to scale the drain conductance
    maxbound : integer
        integer value specifying the maximum number of drains cells that will be
        specified for use during any stress period.
    elev : [double precision]
        is the elevation of the drain.
    cond : [double precision]
        is the hydraulic conductance of the interface between the aquifer and the
        drain.
    aux : [double precision]
        is an array of values for auxiliary variable aux(iaux), where iaux is a value
        from 1 to naux, and aux(iaux) must be listed as part of the auxiliary
        variables.  a separate array can be specified for each auxiliary variable. if
        the value specified here for the auxiliary variable is the same as auxmultname,
        then the conductance array will be multiplied by this array.

    filename : str or PathLike, optional
        Name or path of file where this package is stored.
    pname : str, optional
        Package name.
    **kwargs
        Extra keywords for :class:`flopy.mf6.mfpackage.MFPackage`.
