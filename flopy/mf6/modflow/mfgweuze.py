class ModflowGweuze(MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGweuze defines a UZE package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Model that this package is a part of. Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool, default False
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    flow_package_name : string
        keyword to specify the name of the corresponding flow package.  if not
        specified, then the corresponding flow package must have the same name as this
        advanced transport package (the name associated with this package in the gwe
        name file).
    auxiliary : [string]
        defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  there is no limit on
        the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however,
        lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data
        for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   the number of auxiliary
        variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  comments cannot
        be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary
        variable names.  auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they
        will be available for use by other parts of the program.  the program will
        terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one
        line in the options block.
    flow_package_auxiliary_name : string
        keyword to specify the name of an auxiliary variable in the corresponding flow
        package.  if specified, then the simulated temperatures from this advanced
        transport package will be copied into the auxiliary variable specified with
        this name.  note that the flow package must have an auxiliary variable with
        this name or the program will terminate with an error.  if the flows for this
        advanced transport package are read from a file, then this option will have no
        effect.
    boundnames : keyword
        keyword to indicate that boundary names may be provided with the list of
        unsaturated zone flow cells.
    print_input : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of unsaturated zone flow information will be
        written to the listing file immediately after it is read.
    print_temperature : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of uzf cell {#2} will be printed to the
        listing file for every stress period in which 'temperature print' is specified
        in output control.  if there is no output control option and print_{#3} is
        specified, then {#2} are printed for the last time step of each stress period.
    print_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of unsaturated zone flow rates will be
        printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in which 'budget
        print' is specified in output control.  if there is no output control option
        and 'print_flows' is specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time
        step of each stress period.
    save_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that unsaturated zone flow terms will be written to the
        file specified with 'budget fileout' in output control.
    temperature_filerecord : (tempfile)
        * tempfile : string
                name of the binary output file to write temperature information.

    budget_filerecord : (budgetfile)
        * budgetfile : string
                name of the binary output file to write budget information.

    budgetcsv_filerecord : (budgetcsvfile)
        * budgetcsvfile : string
                name of the comma-separated value (CSV) output file to write budget summary
                information.  A budget summary record will be written to this file for each
                time step of the simulation.

    timeseries : record ts6 filein ts6_filename
        Contains data for the ts package. Data can be passed as a dictionary to the ts
        package with variable names as keys and package data as values. Data for the
        timeseries variable is also acceptable. See ts package documentation for more
        information.
    observations : record obs6 filein obs6_filename
        Contains data for the obs package. Data can be passed as a dictionary to the
        obs package with variable names as keys and package data as values. Data for
        the observations variable is also acceptable. See obs package documentation for
        more information.
    packagedata : [(uzfno, strt, aux, boundname)]
        * uzfno : integer
                integer value that defines the UZF cell number associated with the specified
                PERIOD data on the line. UZFNO must be greater than zero and less than or equal
                to NUZFCELLS.
        * strt : double precision
                real value that defines the starting temperature for the unsaturated zone flow
                cell.
        * aux : [double precision]
                represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each unsaturated zone
                flow. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each unsaturated
                zone flow. The values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables
                specified in the OPTIONS block.  If the package supports time series and the
                Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the 'Time-Variable Input'
                section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series
                name in place of a numeric value.
        * boundname : string
                name of the unsaturated zone flow cell.  BOUNDNAME is an ASCII character
                variable that can contain as many as 40 characters.  If BOUNDNAME contains
                spaces in it, then the entire name must be enclosed within single quotes.

    uzeperioddata : [(uzfno, uzesetting)]
        * uzfno : integer
                integer value that defines the uzf cell number associated with the specified
                period data on the line. uzfno must be greater than zero and less than or equal
                to nuzfcells.
        * uzesetting : temperature | status | infiltration | uzet | auxiliaryrecord
                line of information that is parsed into a keyword and values.  keyword values
                that can be used to start the uzesetting string include: status, temperature,
                infiltration, uzet, and auxiliary.  these settings are used to assign the
                temperature associated with the corresponding flow terms.  temperatures cannot
                be specified for all flow terms.
                * temperature : string
                            real or character value that defines the temperature for the unsaturated zone
                            flow cell. the specified temperature is only applied if the unsaturated zone
                            flow cell is a constant temperature cell. if the options block includes a
                            timeseriesfile entry (see the 'time-variable input' section), values can be
                            obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a
                            numeric value.
                * status : string
                            keyword option to define uzf cell status.  status can be active, inactive, or
                            constant. by default, status is active, which means that temperature will be
                            calculated for the uzf cell.  if a uzf cell is inactive, then there will be no
                            energy fluxes into or out of the uzf cell and the inactive value will be
                            written for the uzf cell temperature.  if a uzf cell is constant, then the
                            temperature for the uzf cell will be fixed at the user specified value.
                * infiltration : string
                            real or character value that defines the temperature of the infiltration
                            :math:`(e.g.,:^{circ}c:or:^{circ}f)` for the uzf cell. if the options block
                            includes a timeseriesfile entry (see the 'time-variable input' section), values
                            can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of
                            a numeric value.
                * uzet : string
                            real or character value that states what fraction of the simulated unsaturated
                            zone evapotranspiration is associated with evaporation.  the evaporative losses
                            from the unsaturated zone moisture content will have an evaporative cooling
                            effect on the gwe cell from which the evaporation originated. if this value is
                            larger than 1, then it will be reset to 1.  if the options block includes a
                            timeseriesfile entry (see the 'time-variable input' section), values can be
                            obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a
                            numeric value.
                * auxiliaryrecord : (auxiliary, auxname, auxval)
                            * auxiliary : keyword
                                            keyword for specifying auxiliary variable.
                            * auxname : string
                                            name for the auxiliary variable to be assigned AUXVAL.  AUXNAME must match one
                                            of the auxiliary variable names defined in the OPTIONS block. If AUXNAME does
                                            not match one of the auxiliary variable names defined in the OPTIONS block the
                                            data are ignored.
                            * auxval : double precision
                                            value for the auxiliary variable. If the Options block includes a
                                            TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the 'Time-Variable Input' section), values can be
                                            obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a
                                            numeric value.
