class ModflowGwfwelg(MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwfwelg defines a WELG package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Model that this package is a part of. Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool, default False
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    auxiliary : [string]
        defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  there is no limit on
        the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however,
        lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data
        for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   the number of auxiliary
        variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  comments cannot
        be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary
        variable names.  auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they
        will be available for use by other parts of the program.  the program will
        terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one
        line in the options block.
    auxmultname : string
        name of auxiliary variable to be used as multiplier of well flow rate.
    print_input : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of well information will be written to the
        listing file immediately after it is read.
    print_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of well flow rates will be printed to the
        listing file for every stress period time step in which 'budget print' is
        specified in output control.  if there is no output control option and
        'print_flows' is specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step
        of each stress period.
    save_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that well flow terms will be written to the file specified
        with 'budget fileout' in output control.
    auto_flow_reduce : double precision
        keyword and real value that defines the fraction of the cell thickness used as
        an interval for smoothly adjusting negative pumping rates to 0 in cells with
        head values less than or equal to the bottom of the cell. negative pumping
        rates are adjusted to 0 or a smaller negative value when the head in the cell
        is equal to or less than the calculated interval above the cell bottom.
        auto_flow_reduce is set to 0.1 if the specified value is less than or equal to
        zero. by default, negative pumping rates are not reduced during a simulation.
        this auto_flow_reduce option only applies to wells in model cells that are
        marked as 'convertible' (icelltype /= 0) in the node property flow (npf) input
        file. reduction in flow will not occur for wells in cells marked as confined
        (icelltype = 0).
    afrcsv_filerecord : (afrcsvfile)
        * afrcsvfile : string
                name of the comma-separated value (CSV) output file to write information about
                well extraction rates that have been reduced by the program.  Entries are only
                written if the extraction rates are reduced.

    flow_reduction_length : keyword
        keyword that indicates the auto_flow_reduce value is a length instead of a
        fraction of the cell thickness. a warning will be issued if the
        flow_reduction_length option is specified but the auto_flow_reduce option is
        not specified in the options block. the program will terminate with an error if
        the flow_reduction_length option is specified and the auto_flow_reduce value
        specified in the options block is less than or equal to zero.
    observations : record obs6 filein obs6_filename
        Contains data for the obs package. Data can be passed as a dictionary to the
        obs package with variable names as keys and package data as values. Data for
        the observations variable is also acceptable. See obs package documentation for
        more information.
    mover : keyword
        keyword to indicate that this instance of the well package can be used with the
        water mover (mvr) package.  when the mover option is specified, additional
        memory is allocated within the package to store the available, provided, and
        received water.
    export_array_netcdf : keyword
        keyword that specifies input gridded arrays should be written to the model
        output netcdf file with attributes that support using the generated file as a
        modflow 6 simulation input.  this option only has an effect when an output
        model netcdf file is configured and the simulation is run in validate mode,
        otherwise it is ignored.
    maxbound : integer
        integer value specifying the maximum number of wells cells that will be
        specified for use during any stress period.
    q : [double precision]
        is the volumetric well rate. a positive value indicates recharge (injection)
        and a negative value indicates discharge (extraction).
    aux : [double precision]
        is an array of values for auxiliary variable aux(iaux), where iaux is a value
        from 1 to naux, and aux(iaux) must be listed as part of the auxiliary
        variables.  a separate array can be specified for each auxiliary variable. if
        the value specified here for the auxiliary variable is the same as auxmultname,
        then the well rate array will be multiplied by this array.

    filename : str or PathLike, optional
        Name or path of file where this package is stored.
    pname : str, optional
        Package name.
    **kwargs
        Extra keywords for :class:`flopy.mf6.mfpackage.MFPackage`.
